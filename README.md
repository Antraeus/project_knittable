Project Concept: Sweater Recipe/Calculator.

The user will be able to enter their yarn weight, knitting gauge (number of stitches and rows per inch that they knit at) and body measurements, and choose what style of sweater they would like to make.  The app will calculate the appropriate pattern and return instructions to the user.  If the user is a knitwear designer, they will be able to input a yarn, an ideal gauge, and select an option to have the app produce a suite of sizes and matching instructions, to create a saleable pattern.

If we can get a key to the Ravelry API (underway but may take too much time to be useful), we can link the app in to Ravelry's database of yarns and yarn stores to make suggestions and provide additional choices like specific yarn brands or fiber content.

The app will have a visual aspect, rendering a schematic of the selected sweater styles as the user chooses them (using the canvas element).
